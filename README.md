# odin-landing-page
This project was an assignment in The Odin Project. The goal was to build a webpage from scratch using the skills learned from the course so far. The design layout was provided by The Odin Project. See [The Odin Project: Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page) for more details about the task.

The artwork in the landing page was created by me.
